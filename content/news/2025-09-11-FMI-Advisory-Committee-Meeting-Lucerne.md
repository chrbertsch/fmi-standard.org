It was great to get the direct feedback, pain points, future needs and ideas from important users of FMI!
It was good to see that FMI is already very broadly adopted and used with great success and benefit. FMI 3, our Layered Standards and SSP already address most of the needs in the mid-term future!

Some topics that were additionally discussed: 

- FMUs have several use cases, and it would be beneficial to consolidate several implementations.
- New computing platforms such as GPUs and Web assembly sandboxes gain importance, and it was discussed how FMI could make use of them.
- FMI usage for (dynamical) optimization gains importance, and there are several proposals to improve this even more.

We also saw that that besides of the FMI Standard itself it is very important to provide training material and usage guidelines. 

Thanks to all participants for the engaged discussions, feedback, ideas!
