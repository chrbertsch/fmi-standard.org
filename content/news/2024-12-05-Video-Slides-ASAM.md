# Video and slides for the presentation "FMI, Layered Standards and ASAM Standards - Enabling Seamless SiL Simulation of Virtual ECUs" at the Internation ASAM Conference 2024 available

Three new layered standards for simulating virtual ECUs with FMI 3.0 were presented:

* FMI-LS-XCP for measurement & calibration with XCP: https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp 
* FMI-LS-BUS for simulation of network communication with CAN (FD, XL), FlexRay, Ethernet, LIN: https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus
* FMI-LS-STRUCT for structured entities like lookup tables: https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct

A demo from tool vendors Akkodis, Altair, AVL, Bosch, dSPACE, PMSF and SYNOPSYS  illustrates the interoperability of these layered standards.
The slides are available [here](https://fmi-standard.org/assets/literature/FMI-LS-ASAM_2024.pdf).
