# FMI Layered Standard for strucutured data (FMI-LS-STRUCT) v1.0.0-alpha.1 published

The FMI Project is happy to announce the publication of an alpha version for this layered standard developed by the FMI Project on top of the FMI Standard.

Layered standards are exentions to the core FMI standard for special applications.

Based on FMI 3.0, this layered standard defines how variables (especially parameters) of an FMU can be structured and grouped in a more flexible way than with the "structured naming convention" of the FMI Standard. 
The first version of this layered standard is focused on the definition of sampled maps.

The alpha version [v1.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct/releases) is available on Github.
