- Continuing work on Flexray and Ethernet support in FMI-LS-BUS with the goal to tag the next alpha version
- Alignment with the VDA SIL standardisation group and clarification of open questions in the scope and usage of FMI-LS-BUS
- Improving the proposal of our Layered Standard for Structured Data (especially for regular grid maps) [LS-Struct](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct)
- Work on the Layered Standard for Reference FMI-LS-REF ([LS-Ref](https://github.com/PMSFIT/fmi-ls-ref)) to define how to provide additional related files inside an FMU with role information
- Concept development for efficiency increase in communicating structured data between FMUs
